# openstreetmap-tile-server

This container allows you to easily set up an OpenStreetMap PNG tile server given a `.osm.pbf` file. It is based on the [latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS guide](https://switch2osm.org/manually-building-a-tile-server-18-04-lts/) from [switch2osm.org](https://switch2osm.org/) and therefore uses the default OpenStreetMap style.

## Setting up the server

First create a Docker volume to hold the PostgreSQL database that will contain the OpenStreetMap data:

    docker volume create openstreetmap-data

Next, download an .osm.pbf extract from geofabrik.de for the region that you're interested in. You can then start importing it into PostgreSQL by running a container and mounting the file as `/data.osm.pbf`. For example:

    docker run -v /absolute/path/to/luxembourg.osm.pbf:/data.osm.pbf -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/10/main overv/openstreetmap-tile-server import

If the container exits without errors, then your data has been successfully imported and you are now ready to run the tile server.

## Running the server

Run the server like this:

    docker run -p 80:80 -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/10/main -d overv/openstreetmap-tile-server run

Your tiles will now be available at http://localhost:80/tile/{z}/{x}/{y}.png. If you open `leaflet-demo.html` in your browser, you should be able to see the tiles served by your own machine. Note that it will initially quite a bit of time to render the larger tiles for the first time.

## Preserving rendered tiles

Tiles that have already been rendered will be stored in `/var/lib/mod_tile`. To make sure that this data survives container restarts, you should create another volume for it:

    docker volume create openstreetmap-rendered-tiles
    docker run -p 80:80 -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/10/main -v openstreetmap-rendered-tiles:/var/lib/mod_tile -d overv/openstreetmap-tile-server run

## Performance tuning

The import and tile serving processes use 4 threads by default, but this number can be changed by setting the `THREADS` environment variable. For example:

    docker run -p 80:80 -e THREADS=24 -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/10/main -d overv/openstreetmap-tile-server run
